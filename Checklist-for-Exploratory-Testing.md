## 🛠️ **Preparation**

- [ ] **Understand the Application:**
  - [ ] Review product documentation, user stories, or requirements.
  - [ ] Familiarize yourself with the application's primary features and functionalities.
  - [ ] Identify areas that are prone to defects or are highly complex.

- [ ] **Define Goals:**
  - [ ] Specify what you aim to discover during the session (e.g., specific features, edge cases, or workflows).

- [ ] **Set Up the Environment:**
  - [ ] Ensure the testing environment is ready and matches production as closely as possible.
  - [ ] Verify test accounts, roles, and permissions.
  - [ ] Prepare necessary test data.

- [ ] **Select Tools:**
  - [ ] Use screen capture tools for reporting bugs.
  - [ ] Use session recording tools to track your actions.
  - [ ] Have access to logs for troubleshooting and debugging.

## 🧭 **Exploration**

### 🔍 **General Checks**

- [ ] **User Interface (UI):**
  - [ ] Check alignment, colors, fonts, and overall visual consistency.
  - [ ] Verify responsiveness on different screen sizes and devices.
  - [ ] Test accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen readers.

- [ ] **Basic Functionality:**
  - [ ] Test key workflows and ensure they function as expected.
  - [ ] Verify navigation between pages and sections.
  - [ ] Test input fields, buttons, and other interactive elements.

- [ ] **Error Handling:**
  - [ ] Trigger error messages by entering invalid data.
  - [ ] Test application behavior with incomplete or corrupted input.
  - [ ] Verify the clarity and correctness of error messages.

- [ ] **Performance:**
  - [ ] Observe the application's responsiveness.
  - [ ] Test the load times for different features.

### 🚨 **Edge Cases and Boundary Testing**

- [ ] Input Fields:
  - [ ] Enter the maximum and minimum allowed input values.
  - [ ] Test with special characters, emojis, and unsupported formats.

- [ ] Workflows:
  - [ ] Skip optional steps and check behavior.
  - [ ] Perform steps out of order and observe responses.

- [ ] Interruptions:
  - [ ] Test application behavior during system interruptions (e.g., network disconnects, app crashes).

### 🔗 **Integration Points**

- [ ] Verify third-party API integrations.
- [ ] Check data flow between modules.
- [ ] Test behavior when external services are unavailable or slow.

### 🛑 **Negative Testing**

- [ ] Test with invalid credentials or permissions.
- [ ] Try accessing restricted areas without authorization.
- [ ] Simulate failure scenarios (e.g., incorrect file uploads, timeouts).

## 📝 **Documentation and Reporting**

- [ ] Take detailed notes of your findings, observations, and questions.
- [ ] Capture screenshots or videos for issues encountered.
- [ ] Document steps to reproduce any bugs.
- [ ] Categorize findings into bugs, feature requests, or potential improvements.

---

## 📊 **Post-Test Analysis**

- [ ] Review your session logs or notes for overlooked areas.
- [ ] Analyze patterns in defects to identify systemic issues.
- [ ] Share findings with relevant stakeholders.
- [ ] Plan follow-up sessions for uncovered areas.

---

## 🔄 **Repeat**

- [ ] Test on different environments, devices, and browsers.
- [ ] Use different user personas and scenarios for varied perspectives.
- [ ] Collaborate with team members to cover blind spots.

## 🎯 **Pro Tips**

- 🕒 **Timebox Your Sessions**: Stay focused and avoid spending too much time on one area.
- 🔀 **Change Perspectives**: Test as different types of users (e.g., novice, expert, admin).
- 🧩 **Use Mnemonics**: Apply techniques like SFDIPOT (Structure, Function, Data, Interface, Platform, Operations, Time) to guide your exploration.
- 🌐 **Refer to Logs**: Utilize application and server logs to uncover hidden issues.
- 📚 **Learn and Adapt**: Continuously refine your approach based on findings and project requirements.
